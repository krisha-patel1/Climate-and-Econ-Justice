# Climate-and-Econ-Justice

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project models **climate and economic justice data for U.S. communities** using a custom **three-layer linked list structure** (State â†’ County â†’ Community). It ingests CSV data and allows for analysis of disadvantaged vs. non-disadvantaged communities, pollution levels, flood risks, and income statistics across regions.

## ðŸ›  Tech & Skills Used  
- **Java** (object-oriented programming, encapsulation, constructors, accessors)  
- **Data Structures** (multi-level linked lists, nodes, traversal)  
- **Algorithms** (searching, insertion, filtering, and aggregation)  
- **File I/O** (parsing CSV files using `StdIn`)  
- **Collections API** (`ArrayList` for dynamic storage and query results)
